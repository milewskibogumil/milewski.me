      👨🏻‍💻 I am a Full Stack Developer at Kryptonum - an agency that creates fast, secure and effective websites. I'm
      responsible for building sites using modern technologies such as Next.js, Sanity.io and Astro. Slow sites are
      annoying, and I'm a freak about their speed and smooth functioning!
    </p>
    <p>
      🤝🏻 I also work as a Developer Team Leader and am responsible for planning the work of developers. I get huge
      satisfaction from teaching others and watching them growing. I like discipline. I value efficient and effective
      cooperation with other professionals as well.
    </p>
    <h2>Why that matters?</h2>
    <p>
      👉🏻 I use headless architecture with an eye on scalability, speed and security. I pay tremendous attention to
      detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      🌐 I have always been interested in technology. I'm fascinated by the Internet - I've been exploring the secrets
      of how it works since I can remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      💼 I help develop the technological aspects of the business - to create products that not only look great, but are
      also profitable for business. I make sure that the customer is well taken care of and I take care of things that
      an online business wouldn't work without!
    </p>
    <p>
      🕰️ I know how important time is and I want to make the most of it. At Kryptonum we work remotely and asynchronous
      communication is very valuable to me. Therefore, a message with clear instructions and Loom dispelling objections
      is a daily bread for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      👨🏻‍🎨 I love creating pretty and useful things. Creating (anything) is one of the most satisfying things in life for
      me. I like to think that there is an element of art in what I do. I use animations and interactions to add magic,
      bring the website to life, increase conversions and... make a WOW effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      💪🏻 I love movement - not only in digital projects, but also in life. I trained calisthenics for a long time. I run
      a lot. The longest distance I have run is the distance of a half-marathon - 21 km. I also like to train at the
      gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      🌡️ Besides, I test my limits and expose myself to extreme conditions - especially the weather. Winter swimming
      (cold plunging) allow me not to forget my primitive instincts. When I want to relax, the ruska banya helps me to
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      💚 I love to travel. Getting to know new places, cultures and people is my thing. I am passionate about a healthy
      lifestyle and experimenting with intermittent fasting, and I also cooking a lot!
    </p>
    <p>
      ✋🏻 I like to talk about life topics. I'll talk about the weather too, but I'm especially interested in business,
      productivity, health and philosophy. I am open to cooperation. I currently live in Warsaw and I like coffee, so
      I'm happy to talk over it!
